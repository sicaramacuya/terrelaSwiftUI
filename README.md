# Terrela App
This project is a iOS mobile application that have well organized information about astronomical objects/missions/rockets. At the point where this README was written there is still changes that I need to be done to finish and have a finalized product.

# Motivation
The motivation for this application was the anoying way of learning about the universe. You just need to move from site to site and it doesn't display all the information in just one place. Also, this product was born in my "Software Product Development" where we had to create our own product without actually developing it.
